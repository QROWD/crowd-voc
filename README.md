# crowd-voc

Crowd-Voc is a vocabulary for describing data that has been produced through crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing is understood broadly, as any type of collective activity to solve a problem or achieve a goal. Data refers to the contributions of the crowd in their consolidated form, which are released in form of a 'dataset' which can be used in other contexts. 
The first goal of the vocabulary is to allow crowdsourcing projects to describe what the data is about and how it came about to facilitate reuse and sharing across projects. The vocabulary should also help repeat and reproduce research that involves crowdsourcing by capturing the key design parameters of a crowdsourcing task and the way crowd answers have been validated, aggregated and otherwise processed before their release as a dataset. Finally, the vocabulary sets the ground for acknowledging contributions by the crowd, towards a fairer model for licensing crowdsourced data.
