## Guidelines for contributing

CrowdVoc intends to be a community effort and as such welcomes different forms of contributions.

#### Issues
Discussion is handled by opening or participating to GitHub issues. We have created the following labels:


**Use case**: For the proposal and discussion of use cases for the vocabulary.
A good use case description should be structured as follows:

- Use case name
- Stakeholders
- Description
- Existing approaches (using other vocabularies)
- Links to other issues (if applicable)
- Links to requirements (if available)

**Requirement**: For the proposal and discussion of requirements 

A requirement is a concise description of a feature deemed useful for the vocabulary. A requirement should be linked to one or more use cases.


**Alignment**: For the proposal and discussion of alignments with other vocabularies and ontologies, including property re-use.


**Classes / Properties** For the proposal and discussion of class and property definitions within the vocabulary. Commonly, these should be linked to requirements and use cases.

#### Pull requests

You may contribute via pull requests with updates or corrections. Just make sure that they close a currently open issue.


#### Code of conduct

We thrive to maintain a positive work environment. As such, we encourage all participants to abide to the W3C code of conduct https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/.
